Columbia Ride Share is for CU community members to create carpools to and from tristate area airports.
Log in using your google or Facebook account to post when you’ll be heading out. 
Or, by joining a ride, you can chat with someone with matching itinerary and hail a ride.

As a student at Barnard college, I was frustrated with the facebook group students relied on to create rideshares to the airport. 
You got notified about each post - regardless of the time, airport, or if you were even traveling. It was tedious to search 
the page for overlapping itinerary and the results were often outdated. 

I created CURideShare to synchronizing travel plans while minimize notifications
